ONE CALL to function ALWAYS RETURNS FULL LINE WITHOUT ‘\n’

Order:

Receive text from read() into array.

If we don’t have ‘\n’ in a text:
	read again and add new letters from read
	continue read the file.

Go through array and searching for ‘\n’ symbol:
	1.if found ‘\n’ then stop, copy text before ‘\n’ in additional malloced array, point **line to this array.
	2.We have rest of line after ‘\n’
